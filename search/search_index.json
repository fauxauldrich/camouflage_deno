We'll be adding same features in this project as and when Deno allows. Why did we create Camouflage if a similar tool already exists?

Using handlebars, you can generate random numbers, string, alphanumeric string, UUIDs and random dates. You can also extract information from request queries, path, body or headers and use them in your response. You can use handlebars to carry out request matching for you.

For example, if the end user passes an Authorization header, you'd want to send a 200 OK response if not you'd want to send a 401 Unauthorized resposne. To do so you can utilize the power of handlebars again. Simply provide an if else condition and you are good to go. Consider following example. You expect the user to call the endpoint /hello-world in two ways. 1) By simple making a GET request to /hello-world.; Or 2) By adding a query parameter name in the GET request to /hello-world. i.e. /hello-world?name=John Based on how the user calls the API, you'd want to send a different response.

This can be done in following manner: Create GET.mock file under the directory ${MOCKS_DIR}/hello-world. And paste following content: {{#if request.query.name}} HTTP/1.1 200 OK X-Requested-By: Shubhendu Madhukar Content-Type: application/json { \"greeting\": \"Hello {{capture from='query' key='name'}}\", \"phone\": {{randomValue length=10 type='NUMERIC'}}, \"dateOfBirth\": \"{{now format='MM/DD/YYYY'}}\", \"test\": \"{{randomValue}}\" } {{else}} HTTP/1.1 200 OK X-Requested-By: Shubhendu Madhukar Content-Type: application/json { \"greeting\": \"Hello World\", \"phone\": {{randomValue length=10 type='NUMERIC'}}, \"dateOfBirth\": \"{{now format='MM/DD/YYYY'}}\", \"test\": \"{{randomValue}}\" } {{/if}}","title":"Request Matching"},{"location":"request-matching/#explanation","text":"We are going to check if a query parameter with the key 'name' exists in the incoming request. We do so by adding an if condition {{#if request.query.name}} You can also check if that parameter equals a certain value {{#if request.query.name='John'}} Rest of the code is self explanatory, where if the condition is true, i.e. incoming request has a query parameter with key name , the greeting field in our response object would be Hello John , else the greeting would be Hello World . Thus if the end user makes a GET request as /hello-world?name=John , he'd get a greeting Hello John . However, if the user calls /hello-world without any name , he'd get a greeting as Hello World","title":"Explanation"},{"location":"request-model/","text":"Request model Request object made available by camouflage is simply an instance of express request object for a given incoming request.
